 **** About the Program ****
This is a simple mergeSort algorithm I wrote in java. MergeSort 
is one of the faster sorting algorithms. It runs in O(nlogn) time
for best and worst case. The only issue is that it temporarily 
uses extra memory while running. This is something to consider
if space is an issue when choosing a sorting algorithm. 

 **** Compile and Run ****
NOTE: I'm assuming your using a UNIX/Linux machine to run this
file. 

1. Download the MergeSort.java and save it in a directory of 
   your choice.

2. Open a terminal and go to where the file is located. Then
   type in the command line:
   javac MergeSort.java

NOTE: You may need to install some extra files to run javac.

3. Now type:
   java MergeSort
   (this will run the program!)
